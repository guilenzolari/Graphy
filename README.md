## Description

Graphy is an iOS app for visualizing and learning about graph search algorithms.

## Features

- Algorithm speed adjustment
- Algorithm switching
- Barrier addition

## Differentiators

- The app is mobile, allowing users to use it anywhere

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 17.5

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/graphy.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd graphy
    ```
3. Open the project in Xcode:
    ```bash
    open Graphy.xcodeproj
    ```
4. Install dependencies and configure the environment:
    - Ensure you have Xcode installed and updated.
    - Connect an iOS device or use a simulator to run the app.
    - Build and run the project through Xcode.

## Usage

### Basic Instructions

1. Open the Graphy app on your iOS device.
2. Select the desired search algorithm.
3. Adjust the algorithm speed as needed.
4. Add barriers to the graph to simulate different scenarios.

### Examples

- Select the "Breadth-First Search" algorithm and observe how it explores the graph.
- Change the algorithm speed to see the execution in real-time at a slower or faster pace.
- Add barriers to see how the algorithm handles obstacles in the graph.
